This project contains a set of wiki pages each of which is a tutorial for use in the learning of basic programming.  
  
These tutorials can be followed individually but are generally designed to be followed in a learning group at one of our workshops.  

For information about our workshops, please see the activities sections on our website:  [futureCodersSE CIC](http://futurecoders.org.uk/).

We run a full programme of activities helping young people (mostly 16-19) to learn about careers in tech, to learn to code, to develop a set of coding and problem solving skills, to gain a high quality, long term, work experience in one of our project teams.  Our app development project teams work in an Agile way to produce bespoke software for charity and non-profit clients.  Student are recruited to project teams and experience the whole process, from requirements setting to deployment and user acceptance.
